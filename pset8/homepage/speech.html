                In this times of supremacist harassing mobbs where the patriots and nacionalists are under attack,
                i'd like to say a few words just because i can.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world nowadays is how it is because great people made great sacrifices when their
                time came. Specially in the western world. Brave, strong and stubborn people who took a step forward
                to fight for the freedom that we enjoy today. For what was the right thing to do. For what the world needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even though, in this weird year we have witnessed -among other things- the rise of an infamous radical-left
                pro-communism and hatred movement called antifa. Whom curiously claim to fight against the fascism, the
                capitalism and the police. Against the law & the order that those brave men sacrificed to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                They wander the cities with weapons, rioting and looting in the name of who-knows-what. They destroy private
                properties. They attack and kill white people, just because. These never-been-hungry mobbs criticize capitalism and
                yet they use iPhones, eat in McDonald's, drink Starbucks coffee, and buy their stuff through Amazon.
                They never saw neither experienced the poverty the ideas they support lead to. They are alive thanks, for, and by
                the capitalism they so-much hate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, they tell everyone how should they think. What should they do. Who should they vote. And if you
                dare to think different, they call you fascist. Funny, right? An anti-fascism movement calling fascist to the
                ones who don't think alike. That's why i remember
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill" target="_blank">Churchill</a>. The man who fought
                against the real fascists. "The Roaring Lion".
            </p>
            <p>
                There's this phrase that perfectly suits the situation, and it goes like this:
            </p>
        </div>
        <quote class="row q">
            "The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists"
        </quote>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Wrapping up, here's a fraction from one of the most famous speeches ever made, besides Reagan's
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_down_this_wall!" target="_blank">Tear down this wall</a>, that i'd like to share:
